    "For our dataset this semester we selected the \"120 years of Olympic history: athletes and results\" dataset from Kaggle. This dataset tracks all Olympians' medal results from 1896-2016, as well as various physical attributes such as gender, age, weight, and height. This dataset was originally collected for various analyses, such as whether host countries' athletes win more medals, and to track the involvement of women in the Olympics from various countries over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our intent this semester is to focus on analyzing the physical attributes of the Olympians over time, when they are available. We would like to determine the trends around age, height, and weight in sports over time, and whether they seem to be trending to some kind of \"ideal ratio\" for each sport. We would like to predict what the body types will look like in the next Olympic games, and in the Olympic Games 120 years out from now, given the current data available. For this analysis we are eliminating linear regression as a viable option, since any non-zero slope would trend to positive or negative infinity, and long-term extrapolation would quickly become absurd. We will attempt quadratic, exponential, and logarithmic regression in order to derive meaningful insights from the data. To consider our analysis \"successful\", our target is to explain at least 80% of the variablity in the data with our regression model, and for the 120-year prediction of height and weight to be within the realm of possibility given existing human means and standard deviations for body types.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We would also like to see how these ratios compare to the average person in order to see which Olympic sports might be the most accessible from a body size perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we would like to analyze our team members' own body types and see for which Olympic sports we might be best-suited, strictly from a height and weight perspective."

    "Year (Integer) - The year of Olympic games, ranging from 1896-2016 in this dataset.\n",

    "About 89% of the rows are missing data in at least one of these columns. This is due to records not being kept that far back in history, or for specific sports. For sports that did not track height and weight at all, we will exclude these from our analysis. For other sports that just contain missing data for some athletes we will run our analysis both by dropping the records entirely and by imputing the values using the mean for the population we are analyzing. Both of these approaches have pros and cons and we will target the approach that yields maximum statistical benefit.\n"
